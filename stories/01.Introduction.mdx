# Introduction

Welcome to the Storybook Components Library for http://vcoles.me, the personal website of Vanessa Coles.

## Purpose

This library is a collection of reusable components that are used across the website. It is built using Storybook, a tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, Vue, and Angular.

## Usage

This is currently for demonstration purposes, as this was developed for personal use. However, as this is a public repository under MIT license, these are free to utilize for your own projects, but support is not currently available.

## Installation

Coming soon...
